Black Hole
-----------
//Only doing stellar black holes since any larger would be kinda insane
// black holes won't be rendered? but maybe show a secretion disk
//math at http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Astro/blkhol.html
int X position (center)
int Y position (center)
int Mass
double Schwarzschild Radius
constexpr double 3/2* event horizon (photon sphere)
